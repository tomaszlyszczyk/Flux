# Flux SISAL

Flux is an App for executing structured workouts on a smart trainer.

- executing Zwift .zwo workouts
- riding .fit courses and activities
- works with bluetooth smart trainers, power meters and heart rate monitors.
- ERG mode and extended manual control of your trainer with Grade Simulation and Resistance mode.
- workouts with [Slope targets](https://github.com/dvmarinoff/Flux/wiki/Slope-target-for-workout-intervals)
- recording .FIT Activities compatible with all major platforms like Strava, Training Peaks, etc
- build-in collection of structured workouts to get you started

The web version is free to use and open source. It is developed as a static PWA, has zero dependancies and is completly independant to run.
Everything happens in your Browser and stays in there. It uses Web Bluetooth, Web Serial, Web Components, IndexDB, Local Storage, WakeLock API.

_Status_: Currently working on creating a backend API and iOS app.

## Supported Browsers

**TL;DR:** Use Google Chrome on Android, Windows 10, Mac (M1 or Intel) and Ubuntu, but not iOS or Apple TV.

A fully featured web version will be released soon, and followed with desktop apps later.
The Web version is running directly in the browser and relies on some of the latest web platform technologies.
Browser support for the web version is the following:

| Chrome | Edge | Opera | Chrome Android | Samsung Internet | Firefox | Opera Android | Safari | Safari iOS |
|--------|------|-------|----------------|------------------|---------|---------------|--------|------------|
| yes    | yes  | yes   | yes            | yes              | no      | no            | no     | no         |


### Linux
On Chrome, Edge and Opera for Linux you might need to turn on the experimental platforms feature flag at

- Chrome: `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`

- Edge: `edge://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`

- Opera: `opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`

NOTE: Opera support on Linux is a bit shaky at moment. Expect updates.

### iOS
For iOS you can try [WebBLE](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webble/id1193531073) which is:

> Very simple web browser that supports an initial subset of the web bluetooth.

It is not tested or supported by this project, but you can give it try if your only option is iOS.

### ANT+

Support for ANT+ is experimental at the moment. It is being rewritten right now and the code is moved to [WebANT](https://github.com/dvmarinoff/WebANT), which has a separate demo. When it becomes stable enough will be merged here. It currently has support for Ubuntu(Linux), and partially for MacOS, and Android. Windows 10 may be possible in the future.


The current development setup is using Suunto movestick mini, Garmin Fenix 5 watch broadcasting heart rate,
Tacx Heart Rate monitor, Tacx Flux S trainer, and X240 laptop with Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS, M1 Mac, and Samsung S9 Android phone.

## The Demo
You can check a pre-release demo of the web version at
[Latest Version on master](https://flux-three.vercel.app/), or [Latest development vesion](https://flux-devel.vercel.app/)

Keep in mind it is in active development and will change and break on daily bases, that's until the first stable version is released.

## Sponsers ðŸ’–

While Flux is free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding. Raising a monthly budget we help cover the development and runnig costs for servers, databases, domains, storage, and others.

You can support the development of Flux via [Github Sponsers](https://github.com/sponsors/dvmarinoff).
